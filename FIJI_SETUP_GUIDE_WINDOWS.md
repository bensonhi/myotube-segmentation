   - `Myotube_Segmentation.ijm` (Linux/Mac version)
   - `myotube_segmentation.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - **`gui/`** folder (contains the multi-tab interface)
   - **`core/`** folder (contains backend processing)
   - **`utils/`** folder (contains utility functions)

### 5.2 Locate Fiji's Macros Folder

1. Open another File Explorer window
2. Navigate to where you installed Fiji (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Fiji`)
3. Open the **`macros`** folder
   - Full path example: `C:\Program Files\Fiji\macros`

### 5.3 Copy the Files and Folders

1. **Select all files and folders** in the `fiji_integration` folder:

   - You'll see progress messages in a console/terminal window
   - Once installation is complete, the multi-tab GUI will appear automatically

---

## Step 7: Using the Multi-Tab Interface

The GUI has **5 tabs** for different processing steps. You can run them independently or in sequence.

### Tab 1: Max Projection

**Purpose**: Apply max intensity projection to Z-stack images in separate myotube and nucleus folders.

**When to use**: If you have Z-stack images (multi-slice 3D images) that need to be converted to 2D via max projection.

**Steps**:
1. Click the **"Max Projection"** tab
2. **Myotube Input**: Browse to your folder containing myotube/cytoplasm images
3. **Nucleus Input**: Browse to your folder containing nucleus images
4. **Output Directory**: Choose where to save the max projected images
5. Click **"Run Max Projection"**

**Note**: You can specify just one folder if you only need to process one channel. Leave the other field empty.

**Output**:
- `myotube_max_projection/MAX_*.tif` - Max projected myotube images
- `nucleus_max_projection/MAX_*.tif` - Max projected nucleus images

   - *Project Path: Browse to your myotube-segmentation project folder

5. **Detection Parameters**:
   - **Confidence Threshold** (0-1): Default 0.25
     - Higher = fewer detections (stricter)
     - Lower = more detections (may include false positives)
     - *When to adjust*: If missing obvious myotubes, lower to 0.15-0.20

   - **Minimum Area** (pixels): Default 100
     - Filters out tiny detections
     - *When to adjust*: If seeing small artifacts, increase to 200-500

6. **Tiling Options** (for large images or dense myotubes):
   - **Use tiled inference**: Check for images with many myotubes
   - **Grid Size**: Default 2 (creates 2×2=4 tiles)
     - 1 = no tiling
     - 2 = 2×2 grid (4 tiles)
     - 3 = 3×3 grid (9 tiles)
     - *When to adjust*: If many myotubes, use 2-3 for better detection

   - **Tile Overlap** (%): Default 20%
     - Overlap between adjacent tiles
     - Helps detect myotubes at tile boundaries
     - *When to adjust*: Rarely needed

7. **Output Options**:

---

### Tab 4: Nuclei-Myotube Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyze the relationship between nuclei and myotubes - count nuclei per myotube and filter nuclei by quality.

**Steps**:
1. Click the **"Nuclei-Myotube Analysis"** tab

2. **Input/Output Folders**:
   - **Myotube Folder**: Browse to myotube segmentation results (from Tab 2)
   - **Nuclei Folder**: Browse to nuclei segmentation results (from Tab 3)
   - **Output Folder**: Choose where to save analysis results

3. **Filter Parameters**:
   - **Nucleus Size Range** (pixels): Default 400-6000
     - **Min Area**: Removes small debris/artifacts
     - **Max Area**: Removes large clumps (likely multiple nuclei)
     - *What it does*: Nuclei outside this range are marked as "filtered_size" (shown in RED on overlay)
     - *When to adjust*: Measure some nuclei in Fiji to determine appropriate size range for your images

   - **Max Eccentricity** (0-1): Default 0.95
     - **0** = perfect circle
     - **1** = elongated line
     - Values close to 1 indicate highly elongated shapes (likely artifacts, not nuclei)
     - *What it does*: Nuclei with eccentricity > 0.95 are marked as "filtered_eccentricity" (shown in YELLOW on overlay)
     - *When to adjust*: If losing real nuclei that are slightly elongated, increase to 0.98

   - **Overlap Threshold** (0-1): Default 0.10 (10%)
     - Minimum percentage of nucleus that must overlap with a myotube to be assigned to it
     - Example: 0.10 means ≥10% of the nucleus area must be inside a myotube
     - *What it does*: Nuclei with <10% overlap are marked as "filtered_overlap" (shown in BLUE on overlay)
     - *When to adjust*:
       - Lower (0.05) = include nuclei barely touching myotubes
       - Higher (0.30-0.50) = only include nuclei with substantial overlap

   - **Periphery Overlap Threshold** (0-1): Default 0.95 (95%)
     - Used to distinguish "central" vs "peripheral" nuclei in the periphery overlay
     - Only affects visualization in `*_periphery_overlay.tif`, not the counts
     - *What it does*:
       - Nuclei with overlap ≥ periphery threshold → GREEN (central)
       - Nuclei with overlap < periphery threshold but ≥ regular threshold → YELLOW (peripheral)
     - *When to adjust*:
       - Set to 1.0 if you want only perfectly centered nuclei as green
       - Lower (0.70-0.80) if you want more nuclei classified as central

4. **Processing Options**:
   - **Full Image Mode**: Check if processing complete images (not cropped quadrants)
     - *When to check*: Always check this unless you manually cropped images into quadrants

5. Click **"Run Analysis"**

**Output Files** (for each sample):
- `[Sample]_myotube_nuclei_counts.csv` - **Main result**: Nuclei count per myotube (includes central/peripheral counts)

  - **Grid reference system**: 15×15 grid with column letters (A, B, C...) and row numbers (1-15)
  - Color coding:
    - **GREEN**: Assigned to myotubes (passed all filters)
    - **RED**: Filtered out by size
    - **YELLOW**: Filtered out by eccentricity
    - **BLUE**: Filtered out by overlap
- `[Sample]_periphery_overlay.tif` - **Enhanced visualization** showing ONLY assigned nuclei:
  - **Semi-transparent filled nuclei** (35% opacity) showing myotube structure beneath
  - **Nucleus IDs displayed offset** to the right on dark backgrounds
  - **Grid reference system**: 15×15 grid with column letters (A-O) and row numbers (1-15)
  - Color coding (central vs peripheral):
    - **GREEN**: Central nuclei (overlap ≥ periphery threshold, default ≥95%)
    - **YELLOW**: Peripheral nuclei (overlap between regular 10% and periphery 95% threshold)

**Combined Summary** (generated after all samples are analyzed):
- `combined_analysis_summary.txt` - **Aggregate statistics** across all analyzed samples:
  - Total samples analyzed
  - Total myotubes and nuclei across all samples
  - Combined filter statistics (percentages)
  - Average nuclei per myotube (across all samples)

### Tab 5: Injury Segmentation

**Purpose**: Detect and segment injuries (damage sites) in myotilin channel images using a trained Mask2Former model. Images are automatically preprocessed and split into 4 quadrants for inference, then reassembled.

**Important - Input differs from Myotube Segmentation**:
- **Myotube Segmentation (Tab 2)**: Expects **preprocessed grey channel images** (already max-projected and contrast-adjusted)
- **Injury Segmentation (Tab 5)**: Expects **raw myotilin channel TIFF images** (e.g., `*ch02*.tif` or `*ch03*.tif` depending on your experiment). The tab automatically applies max projection (if z-stack) and Above130Sqrt preprocessing internally to match the training data format.

**Steps**:
1. Click the **"Injury Segmentation"** tab
2. **Input Directory**: Browse to folder containing **raw myotilin channel images** (TIFF format)
3. **Output Directory**: Choose where to save injury segmentation results
4. **Model Configuration** (first time only):
   - *Config File: Browse to `output_injury\config.yaml` in your Mask2Former folder
   - *Model Weights: Browse to the `model_best.pth` you downloaded (see [Step 4.2](#42-download-the-injury-model))
   - *Mask2Former Path: Browse to your Mask2Former project folder

5. **Detection Parameters**:
   - **Confidence Threshold** (0-1): Default 0.05
     - Injury model scores are typically low — start with 0.05
     - Increase to 0.1-0.2 if seeing too many false positives
   - **Minimum Area** (pixels): Default 30
     - Injuries can be very small
   - **Maximum Area** (pixels): Default 50000
   - **Final Min Area** (pixels): Default 50

6. **Output Options**:
   - **Use CPU**: Check if you don't have a CUDA GPU
   - **Save measurements CSV**: Saves area and bounding box for each injury

7. Click **"Run Injury Segmentation"**

**What happens internally**:
1. Each image is read as raw TIFF (handles z-stacks automatically)
2. Above130Sqrt preprocessing is applied (same as training data)
3. The preprocessed image is split into 4 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
4. Mask2Former inference runs on each quadrant
5. Detected injuries are mapped back to original image coordinates
6. Injuries split across quadrant boundaries are automatically merged

**Output Files** (for each image):
- `[ImageName]_processed.tif` - The preprocessed image (Above130Sqrt, no overlay)
- `[ImageName]_injury_overlay.tif` - Color-coded overlay showing detected injuries
- `[ImageName]_masks/` - Individual injury mask PNG files (one per injury)
- `[ImageName]_info.json` - Processing metadata
- `[ImageName]_measurements.csv` - Injury measurements (if enabled)

## Step 8: Complete Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow from raw images to final analysis:

### Step-by-Step Example

**Starting with**: Separate folders for myotube and nucleus Z-stack images

1. **Tab 1: Max Projection**
   - Myotube Input: `C:\MyImages\raw_myotube\` (myotube Z-stacks)
   - Nucleus Input: `C:\MyImages\raw_nucleus\` (nucleus Z-stacks)
   - Output: `C:\MyImages\1_max_projection\`
   - Result: Max projected 2D images in separate folders

2. **Tab 2: Segment Myotubes**
   - Input: `C:\MyImages\1_max_projection\myotube_max_projection\`
   - Output: `C:\MyImages\2_myotubes\`
   - Result: Myotube masks and overlays

3. **Tab 3: Segment Nuclei**
   - Input: `C:\MyImages\1_max_projection\nucleus_max_projection\`
   - Output: `C:\MyImages\3_nuclei\`
   - Result: Nuclei segmentation NPY files

4. **Tab 4: Analyze**
   - Myotube Folder: `C:\MyImages\2_myotubes\`
   - Nuclei Folder: `C:\MyImages\3_nuclei\`
   - Output: `C:\MyImages\4_analysis\`
   - Filter Settings: Use defaults (400-6000 pixels, 0.95 eccentricity, 0.10 overlap, 0.95 periphery)
   - Result: CSV files and overlays showing nuclei-myotube relationships

**Final Output**:
- `myotube_nuclei_counts.csv` - Ready for statistical analysis!
- `nuclei_overlay.tif` - Verify filtering worked correctly
- `periphery_overlay.tif` - See central vs peripheral nuclei distribution

**Columns**:
- `myotube_id`: Unique ID for each myotube (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `myotube_area`: Area of the myotube in pixels
- `nuclei_count`: **Total number of nuclei assigned to this myotube** (passed all filters)
- `central_nuclei_count`: **Number of central nuclei** (overlap ≥ periphery threshold, default ≥95%)
- `peripheral_nuclei_count`: **Number of peripheral nuclei** (overlap between regular and periphery threshold)

**Example row**:
```
myotube_id,myotube_area,nuclei_count,central_nuclei_count,peripheral_nuclei_count
1,125000,12,8,4
```
This means: Myotube #1 has **12 assigned nuclei total**, with **8 central nuclei** (deeply embedded) and **4 peripheral nuclei** (near edges).

#### 2. `nuclei_myotube_assignments.csv` - **DETAILED NUCLEUS DATA**

One row per detected nucleus. Use this to understand why specific nuclei were filtered.

**Columns**:
- `nucleus_id`: Unique ID for each nucleus (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **`grid_ref`**: Grid reference like "C5", "H12" for easy location on overlay (NEW!)
- **`grid_col`**, **`grid_row`**: Numeric grid coordinates (0-14 for 15×15 grid) (NEW!)
- **`centroid_x`**, **`centroid_y`**: Exact pixel coordinates of nucleus center (NEW!)
- `assigned_myotube_id`: Which myotube this nucleus is assigned to (None if filtered out)
- `filter_status`: One of:
  - `passed` - Nucleus assigned to a myotube (counted)
  - `filtered_size` - Outside size range
  - `filtered_eccentricity` - Too elongated
  - `filtered_overlap` - Not enough overlap with any myotube
- `overlap_percentage`: Percentage of nucleus overlapping with its assigned myotube (0-100)
- `nucleus_area`: Nucleus area in pixels
- `eccentricity`: Shape measure (0=circle, 1=line)
- `circularity`: Alternative shape measure (1=perfect circle, lower=irregular)
- `solidity`: Convexity measure (1=convex, <1=concave/irregular)

**Example rows**:
```
nucleus_id,grid_ref,grid_col,grid_row,centroid_x,centroid_y,assigned_myotube_id,filter_status,overlap_percentage,nucleus_area,eccentricity
408,C5,2,4,1234,2156,3,passed,82.5,756,0.65
431,C5,2,4,1289,2198,3,passed,79.3,812,0.58
156,A1,0,0,234,178,None,filtered_size,0,189,0.72
```
- Nucleus 408: In grid cell **C5**, assigned to myotube 3, 82.5% overlap, 756 pixels
- Nucleus 431: In grid cell **C5**, assigned to myotube 3, 79.3% overlap, 812 pixels
- Nucleus 156: In grid cell **A1**, filtered out (too small - only 189 pixels)

**How to use grid coordinates**:
1. Open the CSV in Excel/software and find a nucleus of interest (e.g., nucleus 408)
2. Note its `grid_ref` value (e.g., "C5")
3. Open the `nuclei_overlay.tif` in Fiji/ImageJ
4. Look for column **C** and row **5** in the grid overlay
5. Find nucleus #408 in that grid cell
6. Or use the `centroid_x` and `centroid_y` values to jump directly to the exact pixel location

#### 3. `analysis_summary.txt` - **STATISTICS OVERVIEW**

**Understanding the Overlay Visualizations**:

#### `nuclei_overlay.tif` - Shows ALL detected nuclei with enhanced visualization

**NEW FEATURES** in this overlay:
- **Semi-transparent filled nuclei** (35% opacity) - You can see both the nucleus color AND the myotube structure beneath
- **Offset nucleus ID labels** - IDs are positioned to the RIGHT of each nucleus (not covering it) with dark backgrounds for readability
- **Grid reference system** - 15×15 grid with labeled axes:
  - Column letters (A, B, C, ..., O) displayed at the top
  - Row numbers (1-15) displayed on the left
  - Use this to cross-reference with the CSV's `grid_ref` column

This overlay helps you understand your filtering:

- **GREEN nuclei**: Passed all filters and assigned to myotubes ✓
  - These are counted in your results
  - Size is within range (400-6000 pixels)
  - Eccentricity < 0.95 (round enough)
  - Overlap ≥ threshold (≥10% overlap with myotube)

- **RED nuclei**: Filtered by size ✗
  - Too small (< min area) or too large (> max area)
  - Likely debris (small) or clumps (large)

- **YELLOW nuclei**: Filtered by eccentricity ✗
  - Too elongated (eccentricity > 0.95)
  - Likely artifacts, not real nuclei

- **BLUE nuclei**: Filtered by overlap ✗
  - Not enough overlap with any myotube (< overlap threshold)
  - May be background nuclei not associated with myotubes

**How to use this**:
1. Visually inspect to verify filtering is working correctly
2. If many real nuclei are being filtered, adjust the parameters
3. To locate specific nuclei from CSV: Look up the `grid_ref` (e.g., "C5"), find that grid cell on the overlay, then look for the nucleus ID number

---

#### `periphery_overlay.tif` - Shows ONLY assigned nuclei (central vs peripheral)

This overlay shows spatial distribution of nuclei within myotubes:

- **GREEN nuclei**: Central nuclei
  - Overlap ≥ periphery overlap threshold (default 95%)
  - Deeply embedded inside the myotube

- **YELLOW nuclei**: Peripheral nuclei
  - Overlap between regular threshold (10%) and periphery threshold (95%)
  - Closer to myotube edges or partially overlapping

**How to use this**:
- If you want to analyze central vs peripheral nuclei separately, you can use the `overlap_percentage` column in the CSV along with your threshold values
- Example: Count nuclei with overlap_percentage ≥ 95 (central) vs 10-95 (peripheral)

## Common Questions

### Q: How do I know if my filter settings are correct?

**A**: Check the `nuclei_overlay.tif`:
- If you see many **RED** nuclei that look like real nuclei → Your size range is too restrictive. Increase max area (e.g., from 6000 to 8000) or decrease min area (e.g., from 400 to 300).
- If you see many **YELLOW** nuclei that look round → Your eccentricity threshold is too strict. Increase from 0.95 to 0.98.
- If you see many **BLUE** nuclei clearly inside myotubes → Your overlap threshold is too high. It's already very low at 0.10 (10%), so this is unlikely. If it happens, decrease to 0.05.
- If you see many small **RED** dots everywhere → That's debris being correctly filtered out. No action needed.

### Q: What's the difference between overlap threshold and periphery overlap threshold?

**A**:
- **Overlap threshold** (default 0.10): Determines which nuclei are **counted**. Nuclei with <10% overlap are excluded from analysis.
- **Periphery overlap threshold** (default 0.95): Only affects the **periphery overlay visualization**. Distinguishes central (≥95%) from peripheral (10-95%) nuclei. Both are still counted in your results.

### Q: Should I use tiled inference?

**A**:
- **Use tiling** (Grid Size 2-3) if:
  - Your images have many myotubes (>20)
  - Myotubes are densely packed
  - You're getting incomplete segmentations
- **Don't use tiling** (Grid Size 1) if:
  - Your images have few myotubes (<10)
  - Myotubes are well-separated
  - Processing time is acceptable

### Q: Why are nuclei counts different between `total_overlapping` and `nucleus_count`?

**A**: `total_overlapping` includes ALL nuclei that touch the myotube, even those that failed filters (too small, too elongated, or insufficient overlap). `nucleus_count` only includes nuclei that **passed all filters** and are assigned to the myotube.

### Q: Can I process images at different resolutions together?

**A**: Yes, the tool automatically handles different image sizes. However, for **analysis** (Tab 4), make sure your filter parameters (especially size range) are appropriate for your image resolution. If you have mixed resolutions, you may need to run analysis separately for each resolution.

### Q: What if myotube and nuclei images don't align perfectly?

**A**: The analysis automatically resizes nuclei masks to match myotube overlay dimensions if needed. However, the images should be from the **same field of view**. If they're from different regions or different samples, the analysis won't be meaningful.

### Q: How do I analyze just central nuclei?

**A**:
1. Set periphery overlap threshold to your desired cutoff (default is 0.95 for ≥95% overlap)
2. After analysis, use the `nuclei_myotube_assignments.csv` file
3. Filter for rows where `overlap_percentage ≥ 95`
4. Count these nuclei per myotube in Excel/Python/R

**Example**: If you want nuclei that are mostly inside (≥80% overlap), change periphery overlap threshold to 0.80, then filter the CSV for `overlap_percentage ≥ 80`.

### Q: How do I use the grid reference system to locate specific nuclei?

**A**: The grid system makes it easy to find specific nuclei when you have 1000+ in an image:
1. **Open the CSV** (`nuclei_myotube_assignments.csv`) in Excel or similar
2. **Find the nucleus** you want to examine (e.g., nucleus #347 that was filtered)
3. **Note the `grid_ref` value** (e.g., "E7")
4. **Open the overlay** (`nuclei_overlay.tif`) in Fiji/ImageJ
5. **Locate grid cell E7**: Find column **E** (5th column) and row **7** on the labeled grid
6. **Look for nucleus #347** in that grid cell
7. **Alternative**: Use the `centroid_x` and `centroid_y` values to jump directly to the exact pixel location in Fiji

**Example workflow**: "Why was nucleus #156 filtered? Let me check."
- Look in CSV → nucleus_id=156, grid_ref="A1", filter_status="filtered_size", nucleus_area=189
- Open overlay → Navigate to grid cell A1 → See RED nucleus #156
- Conclusion: It was correctly filtered (too small at 189 pixels vs minimum 400)

### Q: What if some nuclei have the same color as myotubes in the overlay?

**A**: This can happen because myotube colors are randomly generated by the segmentation algorithm. Since there are hundreds of possible colors, occasionally a myotube might be colored green, red, yellow, or blue - the same colors used for nucleus status. This is a visual issue only and doesn't affect the analysis results. When this happens:
- The **nucleus color/fill** still correctly indicates its filter status
- Look at the **nucleus ID number** (offset to the right) to identify specific nuclei
- Use the **grid reference system** and CSV to verify nucleus assignments
- The semi-transparent fill (35% opacity) helps distinguish nuclei from the underlying myotube colors

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "conda is not recognized as an internal or external command"

**Cause**: Miniconda wasn't added to PATH during installation

**Solution**:
1. Uninstall Miniconda (Control Panel → Uninstall a program)
2. Reinstall Miniconda
3. **Make sure to check "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable"**

### Problem: "Could not find project directory"

**Cause**: Incorrect path configured

**Solution**:
1. In the Myotube Segmentation tab, click "Browse..." for Project Path
2. Navigate to the correct location where you extracted the project
3. Make sure the folder contains `mask2former/` subdirectory

### Problem: Macro doesn't appear in Fiji

**Cause**: Files not copied to correct location

**Solution**:
1. Verify files are in Fiji's `macros` folder (not `plugins`)
2. Make sure you copied the `.ijm` files directly to `macros/`, not in a subfolder
3. Restart Fiji completely
4. Press 'M' key to see if macro appears

### Problem: ModuleNotFoundError when running GUI

**Cause**: Folder structure not copied correctly

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you copied the entire `gui/`, `core/`, and `utils/` folders to Fiji's `macros` folder
2. The folder structure should match exactly as shown in Step 5.3
3. Restart Fiji after copying

### Problem: Analysis shows nuclei only in corner of overlay

**Cause**: This was a bug in earlier versions (now fixed)

**Solution**:
1. Update to the latest version (follow "Updating the Tool" section)
2. The overlay will automatically resize nuclei to match myotube overlay dimensions

### Problem: Segmentation produces no results

**Possible causes and solutions**:

1. **Images are not suitable**:
   - Make sure images show myotubes/nuclei clearly
   - Images should have good contrast

2. **Confidence threshold too high**:
   - Try lowering the confidence threshold to 0.3 or 0.2
   - Re-run the segmentation

3. **Wrong channel**:
   - Use grey channel for myotubes
   - Use blue channel for nuclei

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Image Quality**:
   - Ensure good contrast between structures and background
   - Avoid overexposed or underexposed images

2. **Workflow Organization**:
   - Create a consistent folder structure for each experiment
   - Use descriptive folder names
   - Example: `Experiment1/1_channels/`, `Experiment1/2_myotubes/`, etc.

3. **Parameter Tuning**:
   - Start with default parameters
   - For myotubes: If too many false positives, increase confidence threshold
   - For nuclei: Adjust diameter if auto-detection doesn't work well
   - For analysis: Adjust overlap threshold based on your biology

4. **Validation**:
   - Always visually inspect the overlay images
   - Check a few samples manually to validate automated counts
   - Use the color-coded analysis overlay to understand filtering

5. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process 10-20 images at a time
   - For large datasets, split into multiple folders
   - The GUI stays open for multiple runs - no need to restart!
